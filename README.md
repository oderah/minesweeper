# minesweeper
A simple game of minesweeper


from directory SecondDjango/ run the following

1) source ../venv/bin/activate
2) npm run dev
3) python3 manage.py runserver
4) open browser and go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" to launch new game

to load already created game, go to "http://127.0.0.1:8000/game/:gs_id" where :gs_id is the game session id of the game.


Thanks.
